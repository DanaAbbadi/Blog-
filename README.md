This repo provides an introduction to Django Models and how ORM works.


## Overview

Developing the serverside with python django, I built an application along with a model for storing the data rquired in the application.

Django has a powerful Object Relational Mapper that allows us to persist data using Python instead of SQL.

## Django ORM 

One of the most powerful features of Django is its Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), which enables you to interact with your database, like you would with SQL. In fact, Django's ORM is just a pythonical way to create SQL to query and manipulate your database and get results in a pythonic fashion. Well, I say just a way, but it's actually really clever engineering that takes advantage of some of the more complex parts of Python to make developers' lives easier.

An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code.
